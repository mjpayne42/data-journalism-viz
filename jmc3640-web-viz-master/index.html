        <h5>Who's contributing to the political-campaign committees of Iowa lawmakers representing Johnson County?</h5>
        <p>
           Candidates seeking to represent Johnson County residents in the Iowa Senate overall see more variance in the source of their political-campaign committee's contributions
           than do state House candidates, and have more money funneled into their campaigns, Iowa campaign-finance records show.
           State Sen. Kevin Kinney, D-Oxford, reported the highest amount of campaign contributions received
           from committees — party-affiliated groups, political-action committees, or other institutional supporters — totaling around 84 percent.
           Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, showed the opposite trend, with his committee raising more than 95 percent of his contributions from individuals.
           Sen. Joe Bolkcom, D-Iowa City, received roughly half of his contributions from individuals and half from committees, with a slight edge in contributions from individuals.
           Both Kinney and Bolkcom faced competition from Republican candidates in the 2018 general election,
           while Wahls did not face off against another major-party candidate in the general. He ran against a Libertarian candidate.
        </p>

        <p>
          House candidates raised less in funding and faced less competition in their races, with each candidate being an incumbent.
          Most House candidates received around or less than $50,000 with the exception of Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton.
          That compares to the lowest total among the Senate candidates of $172,882 raised by Bolkcom.
          Kaufmann ran against Democrat Jodi Clemens in the 2018 midterms, and his margin of victory came in at around an 11% lead — about 1,600 votes more.
          He was one of two House candidates, along with Rep. Dave Jacoby, D-Coralville, whose campaign committee received more in contributions from committees rather than individuals.
          Additionally, Kaufmann was the only candidate to run as a Republican and to run in a competitive election.
          The other House candidates ran uncontested.

        <h5>Methodology</h5>
        <p>
          My first step was collecting data from the seven state lawmakers representing Johnson County, narrowing down specific dates of campaign contributions in my search.
          For state senators, who serve four-year terms, I dated my search to align with the first reporting period after their terms and the last reporting period before the general election.
          While Sen. Kevin Kinney, D-Oxford, and Sen. Joe Bolkcom, D-Iowa City, were incumbents, Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, had just launched his bid for his Senate district in 2017, meaning he had less time to fundraise.
          I used the same method for state representatives, but they serve two-year terms, which is a factor of why they received less in contributions than senators.
